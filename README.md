# QuantumGames2020
The aim of this project is to teach some quantum mechanical concepts, for instance photon interference effects, superposition and entanglement. The game scenario is a simplified manifestation of some renowned quantum optics experiments aiming at presenting quantum logical operations in a playable form. This is not a game running on quantum devices, we are just using tools that can simulate quantum behaviour to some extent.
